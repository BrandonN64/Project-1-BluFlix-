# Project-1-Bluflix-

# Description
Description of the project: This is a website that lets you browse movies, see the ratings on IMDB, and search for movies that you want to see. It also allows you to see nearby movie theaters so you have the ability to find nearby movie theaters. This website was designed with a mobile-first approach that way anyone would be able to access it, even on the go. 

# Technologies Used

For this project, a majority of the work was done in Javascript, with some HTML and very little CSS for the styling of the Google Maps API.

# Features we Added

Added a search bar that calls to the IMDB API whenever you search, and shows the results of the search on the page

# Features we wanted to add

Movie Showtimes so you can see what movies are showing near you, and when they are showing
* Didnt get added because the api was made for Ruby, which was a different programming language.

Wanted to add a way to reserve tickets through the website
* Didnt get added because we could not find any compatible API's to make reservations through movie theaters

Wanted to add directions to the closest movie theater through google maps
* Didnt get added due to the limitations of the Javascript Maps API and Google Places API

Wanted to make the name Bluluflix+
* Didnt add it because we thought it was too many syllables and seems like a rushed / poorly thought of name

Wanted to make the logo clickable as a way to return to the homepage
* Didnt get added due to the use of display:none

Wanted to display the google map on the bottom of the homepage
* Didn't get added due to the time it took for the map to load, making the page look unresponsive and poorly made.

Wanted to add a footer to the website with a button that brought you to the top of the page
* Didnt get added because the page was a lot smaller then we originally planned it to be, due to the requirements of the MVP of the page

Wanted to make the Genres Section look better
* Didnt get added because of time restraints and it not being in the MVP
