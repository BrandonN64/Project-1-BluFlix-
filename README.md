# Features we wanted to add

Movie Showtimes so you can see what movies are showing near you, and when they are showing
Didnt get added because the api was made for Ruby, which was a different programming language.

Wanted to add a way to reserve tickets through the website
Didnt get added because we could not find any compatible API's to make reservations through movie theaters

Wanted to add directions to the closest movie theater through google maps
Didnt get added due to the limitations of the Javascript Maps API and Google Places API

Wanted to make the name Bluluflix+
Didnt add it because we thought it was too many syllables and seems like a rushed / poorly thought of name

Wanted to make the logo clickable as a way to return to the homepage
Didnt get added due to the use of display:none

Wanted to display the google map on the bottom of the homepage
Didn't get added due to the time it took for the map to load, making the page look unresponsive and poorly made.

Wanted to add a footer to the website with a button that brought you to the top of the page
Didnt get added because the page was a lot smaller then we originally planned it to be, due to the requirements of the MVP of the page
